1. open terminal
- "pwd" to know which directory I am in know
- "ls" for listing up the files, and "ls -gtr" for listing and sorting oldest modified at top 
- "cd" for changing directory and type "cd sth*" if not sure of the whole name of the file looking for, also for going back to home directory. to go one file back type "cd .."

- "mkdir" for making directory

1. use "code ." to open vs code

## try pull

- "git status"

"git diff" to see what changed, "git pull" to ge the new content from remote
